Our primary goal is to solve the problem stated above while minimizing cost and maximizing efficiency. Using open source libraries such as OpenCV for object detection, low-over protocols like MQTT for IoT, and low-cost development boards including the Teensy for controlling motors and collecting data, we aim to create an autonomous longboard centralized by a discrete Jetson TX2 compute unit. All these technologies were picked due to their ease of use and the tremendous amount of work which has gone into their documentation to give us granular control of each feature.

The first feature would be implemented to address the problem of carrying the board around vis-a-vis an option to summon the longboard. The goal is to reach a level of autonomy where the longboard would be able to navigate its way toward a target location while avoiding obstacles with the aid of computer vision. The second feature allows the longboard to lock on to a target and follow the them around using computer vision, potentially carrying a load on top of it.
