We will need a lab space for construction, a makerspace with a 3D printer, and a large space with obstacles (will most likely be outside) for testing. More may be added to this section as we continue to develop our project.

We need a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and an Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435, which are
being provided by UTA's CSE department for us to borrow. As we continue to develop our project, more may be added to this section.
