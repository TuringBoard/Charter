The need for autonomy has existed for all of human history. Combined with the growth of the AI industry, it has led to autonomous vehicles such as Teslas, self-flying drones, and more. The idea for Turing Board was inspired by these technologies with a  goal to create an electric longboard with a certain level of autonomy. We present a solution for the task of carrying a longboard around and the also provide the flexibility of using a free to use app to control it. The prototype would have the ability to be summoned by the user to their current location and follow a target.
